00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.780
foreign

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.099
I'll share with you the skills that you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.259
need to have to become a back-end python

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.240
developer I'm taking these skills from

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.980
my knowledge as well as doing some

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.779
research and looking at some recent job

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.720
postings relating to python positions so

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.580
that said let's get into the video after

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.220
a quick word from our sponsor before we

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.960
get started I need to thank lenode for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.359
sponsoring this video I've been using

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.098
and working with lenode for nearly three

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.840
years now and they've consistently been

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.520
my go-to choice for hosting my

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.100
applications and servers in fact right

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.540
now I'm using the node to host the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.760
official Tech with Tim Discord bot a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.920
website multiple of my domains and a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.200
kubernetes cluster now lenode was just

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.239
recently acquired by Akamai and as a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.680
part of this acquisition they're going

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.480
to be adding more than a dozen new data

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280
centers around the world in the next

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.320
year lenode makes it super easy to spin

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.940
up servers with their one-click app

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.739
Marketplace and have tons of written

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.420
guides and YouTube videos on their

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.579
channel to help you get started now if

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.960
you're having any issues you can reach

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.240
out to the 24 7 support team and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.220
actually talk with a real human being

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.439
now the node's pricing is simple with no

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.600
hidden fees and full transparency and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.400
you can test out the node services for

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.960
free by using the link in the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.580
description and claiming in a hundred

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.560
dollar sixty day credit for any new

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.420
accounts it's been an absolute pleasure

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.040
to work with lenode over the past few

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.020
years and one last thank you to them for

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.119
sponsoring this video alright so let's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.640
go ahead and dive in now I quickly want

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.080
to mention if you haven't already heard

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.939
I just released a brand new course it's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.740
called blockchain expert if you're

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.720
looking to get into web 3 learn about

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.119
blockchain Technology's solidity web3

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.460
fundamentals Etc then check it out from

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.840
the link in the description I know you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.640
guys will find some value but that said

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.500
though let's get into the skills

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.880
now obviously you can land a python

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.500
developer position without having

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.600
everything on this list but I think if

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.579
you want it to be considered for kind of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.560
a like let's say mid-level or maybe even

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.420
a higher level position you would need

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.399
to have everything here that said I'm

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.720
sure you could join as kind of a junior

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.759
python developer or a junior back-end

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.799
developer and work your way up and learn

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.360
some of the missing skills if you didn't

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.919
have all of so the first thing you're

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.060
going to have to have here pretty

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.459
obvious is python skills you need to

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.739
understand python fundamentals I don't

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.780
think you need to be an expert in Python

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.860
you don't have to know everything about

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.160
like generators uh iterators uh meta

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840
classes all of that kind of advanced

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.300
syntax but I would know for Loops

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.819
functions classes objects and a lot of

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.040
the common and core syntax and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.900
functionality that you'd use on an

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.680
everyday basis

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.239
okay so moving on to the second skill

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.800
you would need to have to become a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.840
back-end python developer this may seem

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.459
a little counter-intuitive but this is

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.040
some basic front-end skills now whenever

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.360
you're working on the back end you're

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.860
still going to be touching aspects of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.360
the front end even if you're not writing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.560
front end code you might have to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.840
understand it digest it kind of look at

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.000
it and read it and for that reason you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.760
should understand some basic HTML basic

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.739
CSS you should understand maybe a little

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.780
bit of JavaScript again you don't need

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.819
to be an expert or a master in this but

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.920
you need to have some fluency and the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.840
ability to at least read some of that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.640
code so I would spend a bit of time

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.200
maybe a week or two kind of looking into

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.760
some of those skills learning how to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.500
build some basic front ends maybe you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.940
want to dabble in something like react

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.980
view angular some other popular

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.080
Frameworks that's up to you but I would

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.879
know some basic front-end skills

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.680
now beyond that knowledge the next thing

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.480
that you would need to know to become a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.940
back-end python developer is some basic

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.040
networking skills now I think you could

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.840
probably get away without having this

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.940
but I would highly recommend spending a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.340
few days learning about basic networking

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.980
so learning about HTTP what is that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.599
protocol how does that work how do you

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.060
serve data over the web learning about

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.459
IP addresses learning about say

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.220
firewalls learning about vpns and just

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.260
again kind of fundamental things related

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.000
to networking maybe you want to learn

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.400
why localhost works the way it does

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.799
about different ports about you know

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.360
kind of standard ports you'd have for a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.159
website versus ports for other services

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.799
again just some fundamental knowledge in

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.959
this area I think will go a long way so

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.260
I would learn about basic Networks

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.480
now moving beyond networking the next

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.639
thing I would learn is related to Linux

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.139
and also I'll clarify here I wouldn't

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.459
learn these necessarily in any

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.320
particular order I think the order I

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.940
have is actually decent but just

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.960
throwing it out there you can kind of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.759
learn this in any order so let me take

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.380
that back the next thing just something

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.259
I would learn would be Linux now you

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.419
want to learn about how to operate in a

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.100
Linux environment so what different

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.620
Linux users are Linux permissions Linux

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.600
commands how do you copy paste move

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.460
files around you want to be comfortable

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.500
working on just strictly the command

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.900
line and not relying on a graphical user

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.699
interface now I actually have an entire

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.860
Linux tutorial series that's designed

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.500
specifically for programmers looking to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.240
kind of learn this basic knowledge so

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.500
I'll link that in the description in

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.060
case you're curious it is completely

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.919
free

00:04:58.919 --> 00:04:59.940
right

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.040
so next after learning Linux I would

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.380
start learning Django and flask which

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.780
are web Frameworks that utilize now

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.280
these are great to learn regardless if

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.419
you want to be a python backend

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.919
developer but I think if you want to be

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.240
a backend developer you're going to have

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.919
to be competent with these Frameworks

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.199
and learn more than just the basics you

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.580
want to learn kind of the intermediate

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.560
and advanced topics within this and be

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.780
very comfortable writing code in Django

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.259
and flask now flask is the more basic of

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.880
these two Frameworks so I would start by

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.039
learning that understand how to create a

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:30.600
website with it how to create an API

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.880
with it how to do security

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.199
authentication logging in logging out

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.120
you may even want to look at websockets

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.039
using flask that could be a cool project

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.139
next though you want to get into Django

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.120
now Django is a lot more complicated it

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.160
has many more tools and features but

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.720
it's used by large companies like

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.780
Instagram Spotify Mozilla National

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.180
Geographic and a bunch of other ones as

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.280
well so just learning Django will open

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.500
you up to a lot of job opportunities but

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.580
again you want to be learning about

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.800
authentication page routing how to do

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.440
apis more Advanced features Django

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.139
extensions databases specifically

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.880
databases and learning the kind of

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.100
database model within Django that's a

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.539
bit complicated but something you

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.220
definitely need to learn if you want to

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.360
be a back-end python developer

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.220
now Beyond Django the next thing that I

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.620
would start looking into is API design

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.960
and just apis in general learning about

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.280
kind of how those work the different

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.800
routes you can set up crud apis more

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.039
complex apis and specifically related to

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.660
kind of permissions and authentications

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.580
around that personally I always find

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.139
that the most complicated stuff is doing

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.180
authentication specifically token

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.220
authentication or other aspects of

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.720
authentication where you have a refresh

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.880
token an expiry date you have maybe

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.680
username password authentication there's

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.060
a lot of different ways to do this and

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.500
it's going to change depending on the

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.240
framework that you're using so I would

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.100
be really really comfortable creating

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.740
apis designing apis working with

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.419
Frameworks like Django and flask maybe

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.759
even fast API and just be comfortable

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.560
doing this almost know how to do it kind

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.479
of off the top of your head to spin up a

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.639
quick API add some authorization or

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.919
authentication understand what JWT

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.660
tokens are and all the other stuff that

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.639
you're going to be using frequently if

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.380
you're a back-end developer now beyond

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.520
that I would also look at stuff like

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.860
rate limiting how you host your apis how

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.600
you make make sure your apis are secure

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.340
and not being hit by too many people

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.560
there's all kinds of stuff to look at in

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.840
this and I'm no expert in this field but

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.099
those are some of the things I would

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.199
start really kind of researching if I

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.819
was thinking about becoming a more

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.440
full-time python back-end development

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.120
so next we move on to probably my least

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.479
favorite topic but this is databases now

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:37.919
the reality is if you want to be a

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.900
back-end developer of any kind you have

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.120
to understand databases this is a very

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.280
very important part of your job and you

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.660
need to know how to create databases

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.940
delete them migrate them do maintenance

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.160
on them add new tables add relationships

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.099
do database design how to host databases

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:55.139
how to protect and secure your databases

00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:57.300
there is so much stuff relating to data

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.280
how to back up your databases how to

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.840
part put part of your database in

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.220
another database and access it from

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.139
somewhere else there is so much stuff

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.000
related to this and that's going to come

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.919
with learning SQL now there's a lot of

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.720
companies now that are using nosql

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.580
databases for example my startup

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.280
velocity uses a nosql database which is

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.259
Firebase however

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:17.819
um you know it's probably a good idea to

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:20.400
understand SQL and I myself took I think

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.860
two SQL courses in University sorry for

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.360
the cut there you can see my cap behind

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.039
me was about to be stopping my recording

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.780
so I had to step in there and fix that

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.460
but as I was saying you need to learn

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.440
SQL you need to understand how to

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.360
structure databases create them query

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.458
them run SQL commands and I would also

00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:38.039
be familiar with nosql databases and

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.419
understand a little bit about how to

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.520
structure your data in a nosql database

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.958
because that's different than working

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.360
with a SQL database with a nosql

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.399
database you're fairly Limited in terms

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.440
of query operations due to the limited

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.720
structure that's imposed so the way you

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.040
structure your data is much different

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.440
and you end up having a lot of redundant

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.720
data that's actually kind of part of the

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.940
design process of working with a nosql

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.339
database anyways look into that you're

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:04.019
going to have to understand SQL I would

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:05.459
kind of focus there and then maybe just

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:07.320
learn a bit about nosql to kind of have

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.120
some experience with that in case a job

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.839
required

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.920
so last thing on my list here is

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.540
something that really should be its own

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.399
job and with a lot of companies it is

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.959
however if you're working maybe for a

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.279
smaller company or I don't know some

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.200
companies just require this you have to

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.080
have devops skills now this really means

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.580
your experience working with the cloud

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.459
you understand how to deploy how to host

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:31.500
specific things how to go in there and

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.700
maybe change something do some

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.080
maintenance uh you should have

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.279
experience working in a cloud

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.700
environment like AWS Azure Google Cloud

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.160
whatever it is this company uses usually

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.440
they require some experience in that

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.959
specific environment now again I really

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.000
feel like this is its own job there is

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.160
so much stuff to learn related to devops

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.660
and I mean this could be a whole video

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.339
on its own how to be a devops engineer

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:54.959
which I'm not even really qualified to

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.360
talk about the reality is that a lot of

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.620
companies are requiring this right so I

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.240
think having a little bit of experience

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.860
with this being able to not look like

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.899
you don't have any experience is

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.339
probably what you're going for in this

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.380
category so yeah learn a little bit of

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.080
devops now I will lastly mention you

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.399
also of course want to learn Git Version

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.899
Control GitHub I think that goes without

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:14.580
saying so I didn't really mention it too

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.500
explicitly but I would definitely learn

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.000
that and that's pretty much a

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.580
requirement for any programming job so

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.540
that's it guys I'm going to start

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.160
wrapping it up here make sure to check

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.779
out blockchain expert from the link in

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:26.220
the description if you're interested in

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.440
web3 or blockchain Technologies and you

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.120
want to become a blockchain engineer

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.800
with that said I will see you in another

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.820
YouTube video
