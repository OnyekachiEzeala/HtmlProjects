1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,780
foreign

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,099
I'll share with you the skills that you

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,259
need to have to become a back-end python

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,240
developer I'm taking these skills from

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,980
my knowledge as well as doing some

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,779
research and looking at some recent job

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,720
postings relating to python positions so

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,580
that said let's get into the video after

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,220
a quick word from our sponsor before we

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,960
get started I need to thank lenode for

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,359
sponsoring this video I've been using

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,098
and working with lenode for nearly three

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,840
years now and they've consistently been

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
my go-to choice for hosting my

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,100
applications and servers in fact right

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,540
now I'm using the node to host the

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,760
official Tech with Tim Discord bot a

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
website multiple of my domains and a

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,200
kubernetes cluster now lenode was just

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,239
recently acquired by Akamai and as a

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,680
part of this acquisition they're going

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,480
to be adding more than a dozen new data

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
centers around the world in the next

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
year lenode makes it super easy to spin

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,940
up servers with their one-click app

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,739
Marketplace and have tons of written

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,420
guides and YouTube videos on their

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,579
channel to help you get started now if

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,960
you're having any issues you can reach

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
out to the 24 7 support team and

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,220
actually talk with a real human being

32
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,439
now the node's pricing is simple with no

33
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,600
hidden fees and full transparency and

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
you can test out the node services for

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,960
free by using the link in the

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,580
description and claiming in a hundred

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,560
dollar sixty day credit for any new

38
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,420
accounts it's been an absolute pleasure

39
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,040
to work with lenode over the past few

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,020
years and one last thank you to them for

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,119
sponsoring this video alright so let's

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,640
go ahead and dive in now I quickly want

43
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,080
to mention if you haven't already heard

44
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,939
I just released a brand new course it's

45
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,740
called blockchain expert if you're

46
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,720
looking to get into web 3 learn about

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
blockchain Technology's solidity web3

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,460
fundamentals Etc then check it out from

49
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,840
the link in the description I know you

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,640
guys will find some value but that said

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,500
though let's get into the skills

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,880
now obviously you can land a python

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
developer position without having

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
everything on this list but I think if

55
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,579
you want it to be considered for kind of

56
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,560
a like let's say mid-level or maybe even

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,420
a higher level position you would need

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,399
to have everything here that said I'm

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,720
sure you could join as kind of a junior

60
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,759
python developer or a junior back-end

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,799
developer and work your way up and learn

62
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,360
some of the missing skills if you didn't

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,919
have all of so the first thing you're

64
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,060
going to have to have here pretty

65
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,459
obvious is python skills you need to

66
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,739
understand python fundamentals I don't

67
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,780
think you need to be an expert in Python

68
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,860
you don't have to know everything about

69
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,160
like generators uh iterators uh meta

70
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
classes all of that kind of advanced

71
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,300
syntax but I would know for Loops

72
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,819
functions classes objects and a lot of

73
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,040
the common and core syntax and

74
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,900
functionality that you'd use on an

75
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,680
everyday basis

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,239
okay so moving on to the second skill

77
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,800
you would need to have to become a

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
back-end python developer this may seem

79
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,459
a little counter-intuitive but this is

80
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,040
some basic front-end skills now whenever

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
you're working on the back end you're

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,860
still going to be touching aspects of

83
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,360
the front end even if you're not writing

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
front end code you might have to

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,840
understand it digest it kind of look at

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,000
it and read it and for that reason you

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,760
should understand some basic HTML basic

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,739
CSS you should understand maybe a little

89
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,780
bit of JavaScript again you don't need

90
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,819
to be an expert or a master in this but

91
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,920
you need to have some fluency and the

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
ability to at least read some of that

93
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
code so I would spend a bit of time

94
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
maybe a week or two kind of looking into

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
some of those skills learning how to

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,500
build some basic front ends maybe you

97
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,940
want to dabble in something like react

98
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,980
view angular some other popular

99
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,080
Frameworks that's up to you but I would

100
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,879
know some basic front-end skills

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
now beyond that knowledge the next thing

102
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,480
that you would need to know to become a

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,940
back-end python developer is some basic

104
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,040
networking skills now I think you could

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
probably get away without having this

106
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,940
but I would highly recommend spending a

107
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,340
few days learning about basic networking

108
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,980
so learning about HTTP what is that

109
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,599
protocol how does that work how do you

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,060
serve data over the web learning about

111
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,459
IP addresses learning about say

112
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,220
firewalls learning about vpns and just

113
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,260
again kind of fundamental things related

114
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,000
to networking maybe you want to learn

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,400
why localhost works the way it does

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,799
about different ports about you know

117
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,360
kind of standard ports you'd have for a

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,159
website versus ports for other services

119
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,799
again just some fundamental knowledge in

120
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,959
this area I think will go a long way so

121
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,260
I would learn about basic Networks

122
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,480
now moving beyond networking the next

123
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,639
thing I would learn is related to Linux

124
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,139
and also I'll clarify here I wouldn't

125
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,459
learn these necessarily in any

126
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,320
particular order I think the order I

127
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,940
have is actually decent but just

128
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,960
throwing it out there you can kind of

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,759
learn this in any order so let me take

130
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,380
that back the next thing just something

131
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,259
I would learn would be Linux now you

132
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,419
want to learn about how to operate in a

133
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,100
Linux environment so what different

134
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,620
Linux users are Linux permissions Linux

135
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,600
commands how do you copy paste move

136
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,460
files around you want to be comfortable

137
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,500
working on just strictly the command

138
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,900
line and not relying on a graphical user

139
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,699
interface now I actually have an entire

140
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,860
Linux tutorial series that's designed

141
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,500
specifically for programmers looking to

142
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,240
kind of learn this basic knowledge so

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,500
I'll link that in the description in

144
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,060
case you're curious it is completely

145
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,919
free

146
00:04:58,919 --> 00:04:59,940
right

147
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,040
so next after learning Linux I would

148
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,380
start learning Django and flask which

149
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,780
are web Frameworks that utilize now

150
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,280
these are great to learn regardless if

151
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,419
you want to be a python backend

152
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:10,919
developer but I think if you want to be

153
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,240
a backend developer you're going to have

154
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
to be competent with these Frameworks

155
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,199
and learn more than just the basics you

156
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,580
want to learn kind of the intermediate

157
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,560
and advanced topics within this and be

158
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,780
very comfortable writing code in Django

159
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,259
and flask now flask is the more basic of

160
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,880
these two Frameworks so I would start by

161
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
learning that understand how to create a

162
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,600
website with it how to create an API

163
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,880
with it how to do security

164
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,199
authentication logging in logging out

165
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,120
you may even want to look at websockets

166
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,039
using flask that could be a cool project

167
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,139
next though you want to get into Django

168
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,120
now Django is a lot more complicated it

169
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,160
has many more tools and features but

170
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,720
it's used by large companies like

171
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
Instagram Spotify Mozilla National

172
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,180
Geographic and a bunch of other ones as

173
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,280
well so just learning Django will open

174
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,500
you up to a lot of job opportunities but

175
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,580
again you want to be learning about

176
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,800
authentication page routing how to do

177
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
apis more Advanced features Django

178
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,139
extensions databases specifically

179
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,880
databases and learning the kind of

180
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,100
database model within Django that's a

181
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,539
bit complicated but something you

182
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,220
definitely need to learn if you want to

183
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,360
be a back-end python developer

184
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,220
now Beyond Django the next thing that I

185
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,620
would start looking into is API design

186
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,960
and just apis in general learning about

187
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
kind of how those work the different

188
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,800
routes you can set up crud apis more

189
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,039
complex apis and specifically related to

190
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,660
kind of permissions and authentications

191
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,580
around that personally I always find

192
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,139
that the most complicated stuff is doing

193
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,180
authentication specifically token

194
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,220
authentication or other aspects of

195
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,720
authentication where you have a refresh

196
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,880
token an expiry date you have maybe

197
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
username password authentication there's

198
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,060
a lot of different ways to do this and

199
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,500
it's going to change depending on the

200
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,240
framework that you're using so I would

201
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,100
be really really comfortable creating

202
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,740
apis designing apis working with

203
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,419
Frameworks like Django and flask maybe

204
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,759
even fast API and just be comfortable

205
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,560
doing this almost know how to do it kind

206
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,479
of off the top of your head to spin up a

207
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
quick API add some authorization or

208
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,919
authentication understand what JWT

209
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,660
tokens are and all the other stuff that

210
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,639
you're going to be using frequently if

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,380
you're a back-end developer now beyond

212
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,520
that I would also look at stuff like

213
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,860
rate limiting how you host your apis how

214
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,600
you make make sure your apis are secure

215
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,340
and not being hit by too many people

216
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,560
there's all kinds of stuff to look at in

217
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,840
this and I'm no expert in this field but

218
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,099
those are some of the things I would

219
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,199
start really kind of researching if I

220
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,819
was thinking about becoming a more

221
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,440
full-time python back-end development

222
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,120
so next we move on to probably my least

223
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
favorite topic but this is databases now

224
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
the reality is if you want to be a

225
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,900
back-end developer of any kind you have

226
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,120
to understand databases this is a very

227
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
very important part of your job and you

228
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,660
need to know how to create databases

229
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,940
delete them migrate them do maintenance

230
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,160
on them add new tables add relationships

231
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,099
do database design how to host databases

232
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,139
how to protect and secure your databases

233
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,300
there is so much stuff relating to data

234
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,280
how to back up your databases how to

235
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
part put part of your database in

236
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,220
another database and access it from

237
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,139
somewhere else there is so much stuff

238
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,000
related to this and that's going to come

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,919
with learning SQL now there's a lot of

240
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,720
companies now that are using nosql

241
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,580
databases for example my startup

242
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,280
velocity uses a nosql database which is

243
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,259
Firebase however

244
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,819
um you know it's probably a good idea to

245
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,400
understand SQL and I myself took I think

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,860
two SQL courses in University sorry for

247
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,360
the cut there you can see my cap behind

248
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,039
me was about to be stopping my recording

249
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,780
so I had to step in there and fix that

250
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,460
but as I was saying you need to learn

251
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,440
SQL you need to understand how to

252
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
structure databases create them query

253
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,458
them run SQL commands and I would also

254
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,039
be familiar with nosql databases and

255
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,419
understand a little bit about how to

256
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,520
structure your data in a nosql database

257
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,958
because that's different than working

258
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,360
with a SQL database with a nosql

259
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,399
database you're fairly Limited in terms

260
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,440
of query operations due to the limited

261
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,720
structure that's imposed so the way you

262
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
structure your data is much different

263
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,440
and you end up having a lot of redundant

264
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,720
data that's actually kind of part of the

265
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,940
design process of working with a nosql

266
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,339
database anyways look into that you're

267
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,019
going to have to understand SQL I would

268
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,459
kind of focus there and then maybe just

269
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,320
learn a bit about nosql to kind of have

270
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
some experience with that in case a job

271
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
required

272
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,920
so last thing on my list here is

273
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,540
something that really should be its own

274
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,399
job and with a lot of companies it is

275
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,959
however if you're working maybe for a

276
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,279
smaller company or I don't know some

277
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,200
companies just require this you have to

278
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,080
have devops skills now this really means

279
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,580
your experience working with the cloud

280
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,459
you understand how to deploy how to host

281
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,500
specific things how to go in there and

282
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,700
maybe change something do some

283
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,080
maintenance uh you should have

284
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,279
experience working in a cloud

285
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,700
environment like AWS Azure Google Cloud

286
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,160
whatever it is this company uses usually

287
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,440
they require some experience in that

288
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,959
specific environment now again I really

289
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,000
feel like this is its own job there is

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
so much stuff to learn related to devops

291
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,660
and I mean this could be a whole video

292
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,339
on its own how to be a devops engineer

293
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,959
which I'm not even really qualified to

294
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,360
talk about the reality is that a lot of

295
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,620
companies are requiring this right so I

296
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,240
think having a little bit of experience

297
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,860
with this being able to not look like

298
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,899
you don't have any experience is

299
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,339
probably what you're going for in this

300
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,380
category so yeah learn a little bit of

301
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,080
devops now I will lastly mention you

302
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,399
also of course want to learn Git Version

303
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,899
Control GitHub I think that goes without

304
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,580
saying so I didn't really mention it too

305
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,500
explicitly but I would definitely learn

306
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
that and that's pretty much a

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,580
requirement for any programming job so

308
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,540
that's it guys I'm going to start

309
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,160
wrapping it up here make sure to check

310
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,779
out blockchain expert from the link in

311
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,220
the description if you're interested in

312
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,440
web3 or blockchain Technologies and you

313
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
want to become a blockchain engineer

314
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,800
with that said I will see you in another

315
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,820
YouTube video

316
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,000
